## The Local News Giant

Citynews is Italy's largest local news network, with over 50 publications covering all major Italian cities. As Head of UX/UI, I led an unprecedented digital transformation.

# Objective
Visual characterization of the new "Dossier" post format, the new investigative channel by modifying the user opt-in flow integrating social logins and designing the paid subscription flow for exclusive content.
The project was co-financed by Google within the editorial digital transformation optimization projects for Italy.


## The Challenge

- **50+ Different Publications**: Each city had its own visual identity and editorial workflows
- **Thousands of Journalists**: Different workflows consolidated over the years
- **Millions of Readers**: Audience with different expectations and behaviors by city
- **Legacy Systems**: Outdated CMS and custom Scalable Design System with significant technical limitations


## Solution

// ### Scalable Design System

// Creation of a system that respected local identities while maintaining coherence

### Subscription - Citynews

For the subscription system, a checkout cart and a customizable dynamic paywall system for A/B testing and a landing page with price table and call to action were designed.
