  description:
    "Development of AI-powered interfaces for neuroimaging analysis that revolutionized the workflow of 200+ doctors, reducing diagnosis time by 40% and ensuring 99.8% uptime for critical cases.",

  extendedDescription: `

  As Frontend Developer, I was responsible for designing and implementing the front-end service of the platform.

  ## Main Objective
Enable neuroscientists to upload, analyze, and visualize fMRI data through a clear, minimal, and functional web interface, optimized for scientific workflows, without requiring advanced technical background.

// ## MY HUMAN-CENTERED STRATEGY
    
### User-Centered UX Design Approach:

My working method is based on continuous collaboration with stakeholders, through co-design sessions that foster discussion and alignment of objectives. Through an iterative prototyping process, interfaces are tested and validated directly, ensuring concrete and effective solutions. This translates into a key principle: simplicity first. Technical complexity is hidden behind clear and intuitive interfaces, capable of ensuring immediate use even in high-pressure situations.
    
1. **Co-design Sessions**: workshops with stakeholders
2. **Iterative Prototyping**: tested in real clinical context
// 3. **Performance-First**: every millisecond counts in emergencies
4. **Simplicity-First**: hide technical complexity behind intuitive interfaces
// 5. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AAA for different abilities 

## Target Users

The interface design was guided by analyzing the needs of different professional profiles who daily interact with complex data and advanced neuroimaging tools. 
// Each user category requires optimized workflows and specific solutions for their operational context:

</div>
    
// // - **Senior Neurologists**: complex diagnoses, rapid decisions
// - **Neuroscientists**:
//  clinical research and quantitative analysis
// // - **Resident Doctors**: educational support, guided analysis  
// - **Radiology Technicians**: optimized workflows, quality control
// - **Medical Researchers**: dataset analysis, pattern recognition

// # HERO STATEMENT
    
// As Frontend Lead, I transformed neurological analysis for 200+ doctors, reducing diagnosis time by 40% through intuitive and performant AI-powered interfaces for quantitative brain analysis.
    

# UI Design

</div>

# Prototype Validation

After validating individual screens, I created a basic prototype to validate the flows.

</div>


### Header

### Upload Flow

The flow supports uploading single files and folders and can be activated by clicking the button in the header or dragging a file or folder into the upload area.
File validation is performed before upload.

  <img src="./images/qb/upload_3.png" alt="Step 3 - Results visualization" />
</div>

### Notifications
The notification system is based on websockets and signals analysis status changes through a badge with list and sound notifications for completion and error in an analysis. Useful for large data volume analysis.

<div class="my-8 grid grid-cols-1 gap-4">
  <img src="./images/qb/notifications.png" alt="Notifications dropdown list" />
</div>

### Discovery Flow

The analysis detail opens by clicking on an analysis in the list. The detail can be viewed in two distinct ways accessible from the top tab, results can be filtered through checkboxes that manage data granularly.

- Tabular visualization
- Aggregated graphical visualization (next feature)

  <img src="./images/qb/detail_guide.png" alt="Detail guide opened" />
</div>


### Application Settings

The application preferences interface allows granular management of:

- user access data
- graphical interface
- privacy preferences

  <img src="./images/qb/detail_guide.png" alt="Detail guide opened" />
</div>

// ## THE CRITICAL PROBLEM
    
// Neurologists and neuroscientists were losing precious hours manually analyzing fMRI brain scans, causing:
    
// - **Diagnostic delays**: 45+ minutes per single scan
// - **Fragmented workflows**: data scattered across different systems
// - **Technical complexity**: access barriers for non-technical users
// - **Manual interpretation**: process subject to errors
// - **Lack of standardization**: non-comparable results
