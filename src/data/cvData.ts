  profile:
    "Digital Project Manager with 15+ years of experience in design, front-end development, and digital product leadership. I combine creative vision, technical expertise, and strategic thinking to define goals, optimize resources, and align stakeholders in agile environments. I have led multidisciplinary teams and delivered data-driven solutions across healthcare, publishing, SaaS, and corporate identity.",
  approch:
    "My approach as a UX Engineer integrates research and design with technical implementation. I start from analyzing user needs and business goals, translating them into wireframes, prototypes, and scalable design systems. I then bring these solutions to life through front-end development (React, Next.js, Angular), ensuring full consistency between design and the actual product. This methodology accelerates processes, reduces gaps between designers and developers, and delivers seamless, measurable user experiences.",
